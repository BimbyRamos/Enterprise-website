========================================
FIX: "publishedAt" Field Name Error
========================================

ERROR MESSAGE:
"This name cannot be used in your content type as it might break other functionalities"

PROBLEM:
"publishedAt" is a RESERVED WORD in Strapi - it's automatically created by Strapi's draft/publish system.

SOLUTION:
Use "publicationDate" instead of "publishedAt"

========================================
UPDATED ARTICLE CONTENT TYPE - FIELD 8
========================================

WRONG:
□ Field 8: Date (datetime)
   Name: publishedAt ← RESERVED WORD!

CORRECT:
□ Field 8: Date (datetime)
   Name: publicationDate ← Use this instead!
   Type: datetime
   Click "Finish"

========================================
COMPLETE ARTICLE FIELDS (CORRECTED)
========================================

□ Field 1: Text (Short text)
   Name: title
   ☑ Required field

□ Field 2: UID
   Name: slug
   Attached field: title ← Don't forget!
   ☑ Required field

□ Field 3: Text (Long text)
   Name: excerpt
   ☑ Required field

□ Field 4: Rich text
   Name: content
   ☑ Required field

□ Field 5: Text (Short text)
   Name: category

□ Field 6: Text (Short text)
   Name: author

□ Field 7: Media (Single media)
   Name: featuredImage
   Type: Single media
   Allowed types: ☑ Images only

□ Field 8: Date (datetime)
   Name: publicationDate ← CHANGED!
   Type: datetime

Then click "Save" and wait for restart!

========================================
WHY THIS HAPPENS
========================================

Strapi automatically creates these fields:
- id
- createdAt
- updatedAt
- publishedAt ← This one!
- createdBy
- updatedBy

You can't create fields with these names because Strapi already uses them internally!

========================================
CONTINUE WITH ARTICLE
========================================

1. Change Field 8 name from "publishedAt" to "publicationDate"
2. Complete all 8 fields
3. Click "Save"
4. Wait for Strapi to restart

========================================
