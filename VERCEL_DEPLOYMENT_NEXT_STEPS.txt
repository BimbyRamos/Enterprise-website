✅ BUILD FIXES PUSHED TO GITHUB!
=================================

🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED:
1. ✅ Removed experimental optimizeCss feature (was causing critters error)
2. ✅ Removed output: 'standalone' (not needed for Vercel)
3. ✅ Fixed ESLint configuration
4. ✅ All changes pushed to GitHub (commit: 56d6621)

🚀 YOUR NEXT STEPS TO DEPLOY:

OPTION 1: AUTOMATIC REDEPLOY (RECOMMENDED)
-------------------------------------------
Vercel will automatically detect the new commit and redeploy.

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your project: ncvi_enterprisewebsite
3. Wait 1-2 minutes - Vercel should automatically start a new deployment
4. Watch the deployment progress
5. Once complete, your site will be live!


OPTION 2: MANUAL REDEPLOY
--------------------------
If automatic deployment doesn't start:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on your project: ncvi_enterprisewebsite
3. Click the "Deployments" tab
4. Click the "..." menu on the latest deployment
5. Click "Redeploy"
6. Confirm the redeploy


OPTION 3: FRESH DEPLOYMENT
---------------------------
If you want to start fresh:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com
2. Click "Add New Project"
3. Select "Import Git Repository"
4. Choose: BimbyRamos/Enterprise-website
5. Vercel will auto-detect Next.js settings
6. Click "Deploy"


📊 WHAT TO EXPECT:
- Build time: 2-4 minutes
- The build should now complete successfully
- You'll get a live URL like: https://your-project.vercel.app


✅ BUILD SHOULD NOW SUCCEED!
The errors have been fixed:
- No more "critters" module error

- Clean Next.js configuration


💡 AFTER DEPLOYMENT:
Once deployed, you'll receive:
