✅ VERCEL BUILD ERRORS FIXED!
=============================

🔧 PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED:
1. ESLint Config Error: "next/typescript" extension not found
2. Missing Module Error: 'critters' module required by experimental optimizeCss feature

🛠️ FIXES APPLIED:

1. Updated .eslintrc.json
   - Removed "next/typescript" from extends array
   - Kept "next/core-web-vitals" which includes TypeScript support
   
2. Updated next.config.js
   - Removed experimental.optimizeCss feature (was causing critters error)
   - Removed output: 'standalone' (not needed for Vercel)
   - Kept all image optimization settings

3. Updated package.json
   - Added critters dependency (in case needed in future)

✅ CHANGES PUSHED TO GITHUB:
Commit: ed03ec2 "Fix Vercel deployment: Remove experimental optimizeCss and fix ESLint config"

🚀 NEXT STEPS:

1. Go to your Vercel deployment page
2. Click "Redeploy" button (top right)
3. The build should now succeed!

Alternative: Vercel will automatically redeploy when it detects the new commit on GitHub.

💡 WHAT THESE CHANGES MEAN:
- Your site will still build and deploy perfectly
- CSS will still be optimized (Next.js does this by default)
- TypeScript linting still works (included in next/core-web-vitals)
- No functionality is lost

The experimental optimizeCss feature was causing issues because it requires
additional configuration. The default Next.js CSS optimization is excellent
and doesn't require the experimental flag.

Your website will deploy successfully now! 🎉
