FIX: Industry Content Type Save Error
========================================

PROBLEM:
"An error occurred" when trying to save Industry content type

========================================
COMMON CAUSES & SOLUTIONS
========================================

1. DUPLICATE FIELD NAME
   ❌ Problem: You might have used "slug" twice
   ✅ Solution: Make sure each field name is unique
   
   Check that you only have ONE "slug" field

2. RESERVED WORD USED
   ❌ Problem: Field name conflicts with Strapi
   ✅ Solution: Check these field names:
      - title ✓ (OK)
      - slug ✓ (OK)
      - description ✓ (OK)
      - icon ✓ (OK)
      - gradient ✓ (OK)
      - keyPoints ✓ (OK)
      - stats ✓ (OK)
      - featuredImage ✓ (OK)
   
   All Industry fields should be fine!

3. STRAPI IS BUSY
   ❌ Problem: Strapi is still processing previous save
   ✅ Solution: Wait 30 seconds and try again

4. DATABASE CONNECTION ISSUE
   ❌ Problem: Strapi lost connection to database
   ✅ Solution: Restart Strapi
      - Stop Strapi (Ctrl + C)
      - cd strapi
      - npm run develop

5. MISSING REQUIRED CONFIGURATION
   ❌ Problem: UID field not properly configured
   ✅ Solution: For the "slug" field, make sure:
      - Type: UID
      - Attached field: title ← IMPORTANT!
      - Required: ☑ Checked

========================================
STEP-BY-STEP FIX
========================================

OPTION 1: Check Your Fields
----------------------------
1. Look at the Industry content type you're creating
2. Verify you have exactly 8 fields:
   □ title (Text Short, Required)
   □ slug (UID, Attached to: title, Required)
   □ description (Text Long, Required)
   □ icon (Text Short)
   □ gradient (Text Short)
   □ keyPoints (JSON)
   □ stats (JSON)
   □ featuredImage (Media Single)

3. Make sure NO field names are duplicated
4. Try clicking "Save" again


OPTION 2: Check Strapi Terminal
--------------------------------
1. Look at the terminal where Strapi is running
2. Look for error messages (usually in red)
3. Common errors:
   - "Duplicate field name" → Remove duplicate
   - "Invalid field configuration" → Check UID field
   - "Database error" → Restart Strapi


OPTION 3: Start Over with Industry
-----------------------------------
1. Click "Cancel" or close the Industry content type
2. Go back to Content-Type Builder
3. Delete the Industry content type if it was partially created
4. Create Industry again from scratch
5. Add fields one by one carefully


OPTION 4: Restart Strapi
-------------------------
1. Stop Strapi (Ctrl + C in terminal)
2. Wait 5 seconds
3. Start again:
   cd strapi
   npm run develop
4. Wait for Strapi to fully start
5. Try creating Industry content type again

========================================
MOST LIKELY CAUSE
========================================

The "slug" field might not be properly configured!

When creating the slug field:
1. Select "UID" type
2. Name: slug
3. **Attached field: title** ← Don't forget this!
4. Required: ☑ Check this
5. Click "Finish"

If you forgot to set "Attached field: title", 
Strapi will show an error when saving.

========================================
QUICK FIX
========================================

1. Cancel the current Industry creation
2. Start over
3. When you get to the "slug" field:
   - Type: UID
   - Name: slug
   - Attached field: title ← CRITICAL!
   - Required: ☑
4. Continue with other fields
5. Click "Save"

========================================
IF STILL HAVING ISSUES
========================================

Check the Strapi terminal output and look for:
- Red error messages
- Stack traces
- Database errors
- Port conflicts

Then try:
1. Restart Strapi completely
2. Check that Project and Service were saved successfully
3. Try creating Industry again

========================================
ALTERNATIVE: SKIP INDUSTRY FOR NOW
========================================

If Industry keeps failing:
1. Skip it temporarily
2. Create Article content type first
3. Come back to Industry later
4. Sometimes Strapi needs a restart between content types
