🚨 PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: VERCEL IS USING WRONG REPOSITORY!
=========================================================

❌ THE ISSUE:
Vercel is deploying from: github.com/BimbyRamos/ncvi_enterprisewebsite
Your code is pushed to:   github.com/BimbyRamos/Enterprise-website

These are TWO DIFFERENT repositories!

✅ SOLUTION - OPTION 1: UPDATE VERCEL PROJECT (RECOMMENDED)
------------------------------------------------------------
Reconnect Vercel to the correct repository:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on your project: ncvi_enterprisewebsite
3. Go to "Settings" tab
4. Click "Git" in the left sidebar
5. Click "Disconnect" to disconnect the old repo
6. Click "Connect Git Repository"
7. Select: BimbyRamos/Enterprise-website (the correct one!)
8. Click "Connect"
9. Go back to "Deployments" and click "Redeploy"


✅ SOLUTION - OPTION 2: PUSH TO THE OLD REPOSITORY
---------------------------------------------------
If you want to keep using ncvi_enterprisewebsite repo:

1. Go to: https://github.com/BimbyRamos/ncvi_enterprisewebsite
2. Check if this repo exists and has old code
3. If it exists, you can either:
   a) Delete it and use Enterprise-website instead (recommended)
   b) Push your current code to ncvi_enterprisewebsite

To push to ncvi_enterprisewebsite (if you want to keep it):
   git remote add old https://github.com/BimbyRamos/ncvi_enterprisewebsite.git
   git push old main --force


✅ SOLUTION - OPTION 3: CREATE NEW VERCEL PROJECT (EASIEST)
------------------------------------------------------------
Start fresh with the correct repository:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com
2. Click "Add New Project"
3. Click "Import Git Repository"
4. Select: BimbyRamos/Enterprise-website
5. Vercel will auto-detect Next.js
6. Click "Deploy"

This will create a new deployment with the correct code!


🎯 RECOMMENDED ACTION:
Use OPTION 3 (Create New Project) - it's the fastest and cleanest solution.
Your fixed code is already on GitHub at Enterprise-website repository.


💡 WHY THIS HAPPENED:
You likely created the Vercel project before pushing to GitHub, or
connected it to an older repository. The fixes we made are in the
Enterprise-website repo, but Vercel is still looking at the old one.
