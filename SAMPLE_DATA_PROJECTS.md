## Project 4: Data Center Consolidation

**title:** Data Center Consolidation

**description:** Consolidated five regional data centers into two modern, highly available facilities with disaster recovery capabilities.

**category:** Data Center

**projectStatus:** Completed

**client:** Manufacturing Corporation

**duration:** 14 months

**team:** 20 engineers

**challenge:** The client operated five aging data centers with high operational costs, inconsistent infrastructure, and no disaster recovery plan. Consolidation needed to occur without business disruption.

**solution:** Built two state-of-the-art data centers with active-active configuration, implemented VMware virtualization for workload mobility, deployed NetApp storage with replication, and established automated disaster recovery procedures.

**outcome:** Reduced data center footprint by 60%, lowered operational costs by 45%, achieved RPO of 15 minutes and RTO of 4 hours, and improved overall system reliability to 99.99% uptime.

**technologies:** (JSON format)
