QUICK FIX - "An error occurred" when saving
========================================

TRY THESE IN ORDER:

1. CHECK THE SLUG FIELD
   When you created the "slug" field, did you set:
   - Attached field: title ← THIS IS REQUIRED!
   
   If you forgot this, the save will fail.
   
   FIX: Cancel and recreate Industry with slug properly configured


2. WAIT AND TRY AGAIN
   Sometimes Strapi is still processing.
   
   FIX: Wait 30 seconds, then click "Save" again


3. CHECK FOR DUPLICATE FIELD NAMES
   Make sure you don't have two fields with the same name.
   
   FIX: Review all 8 fields, remove any duplicates


4. RESTART STRAPI
   Strapi might be in a bad state.
   
   FIX:
   - Stop Strapi (Ctrl + C)
   - cd strapi
   - npm run develop
   - Try creating Industry again


5. CHECK STRAPI TERMINAL
   Look for red error messages in the terminal.
   
   Common errors:
   - "Duplicate field" → Remove duplicate field
   - "Invalid UID" → Fix slug field configuration
   - "Database error" → Restart Strapi

========================================
MOST COMMON ISSUE: SLUG FIELD
========================================

The slug field MUST have "Attached field" set!

✅ CORRECT:
   Type: UID
   Name: slug
   Attached field: title ← MUST BE SET!
   Required: ☑

❌ WRONG:
   Type: UID
   Name: slug
   Attached field: (empty) ← This causes error!

========================================
WHAT TO DO NOW
========================================

1. Look at the Strapi terminal - any red errors?
2. If yes, tell me what the error says
3. If no specific error, try restarting Strapi
4. Then recreate Industry content type
