STRAPI RESERVED WORDS - AVOID THESE!
========================================

When creating content type fields, DO NOT use these names:

❌ RESERVED WORDS (Will cause errors):
   - status          → Use: projectStatus, orderStatus, etc.
   - id              → Automatically created by Strapi
   - createdAt       → Automatically created by Strapi
   - updatedAt       → Automatically created by Strapi
   - publishedAt     → Automatically created by Strapi
   - createdBy       → Automatically created by Strapi
   - updatedBy       → Automatically created by Strapi
   - locale          → Used by i18n plugin
   - localizations   → Used by i18n plugin

========================================
SAFE ALTERNATIVES
========================================

Instead of:          Use:
-----------          ----
status          →    projectStatus, orderStatus, taskStatus
id              →    externalId, referenceId, customId
publishedAt     →    publicationDate, releaseDate, launchDate

========================================
FOR YOUR PROJECT CONTENT TYPE
========================================

✅ CORRECT:
   Field Name: projectStatus
   Type: Enumeration
   Values: Completed, InProgress, Planned

❌ WRONG:
   Field Name: status
   (This will show the error you saw!)

========================================
WHY THESE ARE RESERVED
========================================

Strapi uses these field names internally for:
- Database operations (id, createdAt, updatedAt)
- Publishing workflow (publishedAt, status)
- User tracking (createdBy, updatedBy)
- Internationalization (locale, localizations)

Using them would conflict with Strapi's core functionality!

========================================
QUICK CHECK
========================================

Before creating a field, ask yourself:
"Does Strapi already use this name for something?"

If yes → Add a prefix or be more specific
If no → You're good to go!
